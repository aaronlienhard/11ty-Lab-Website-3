## What is Docker?

- Docker is an open platform that allows the user to virtually create different software packages in things called, "containers"

## Why is Docker so powerful?

- Docker is so powerful because you're able to very easily create software and play around with it very quickly without having to worry about a lot of the backend part of the code and how getting the server up and running works
